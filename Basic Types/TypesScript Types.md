# What is a type in TypeScript
 - In TypeScript, a type is a convenient way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has. A value is anything that you can assign to a variable e.g., a number, a string, an array, an object, and a function.

## Types in TypeScript
TypeScript inherits the built-in types from JavaScript. TypeScript types are categorized into:

- Primitive types
- Object types

### The following illustrates the primitive types in TypeScript:

- string:	represents text data
- number:	represents numeric values
- boolean:	has true and false values
- null:	has one value = null
- undefined:	has one value: undefined. It is a default value of an uninitialized variable
- symbol: 	represents a unique constant value

### Object types
Object types are functions, arrays, classes, etc. Later, youâ€™ll learn how to create custom object types.

### Purposes of types in TypeScript
There are two main purposes of types in TypeScript:

- First, types are used by the TypeScript compiler to analyze your code for errors
- Second, types allow you to understand what values are associated with variables.
