# Advanced Types

## TypeScript Intersection Types
An intersection type creates a new type by combining multiple existing types. The new type has all features of the existing types.

```
type typeAB = typeA & typeB;

```

## Type Casting
JavaScript doesnâ€™t have a concept of typecasting because variables have dynamic types. However, every variable in TypeScript has a type. Type castings allow you to convert a variable from one type to another.

In TypeScript, you can use the "as" keyword or <> operator for type castings.
